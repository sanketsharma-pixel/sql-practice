# Restaurant Data Analysis Questions

This document contains a list of data analysis questions based on the `restaurant_db` schema, designed to test skills from beginner to advanced levels.

## Database Schema
*   **order_details**: `order_details_id` (PK), `order_id`, `order_date`, `order_time`, `item_id` (FK)
*   **menu_items**: `menu_item_id` (PK), `item_name`, `category`, `price`

1.  **View the Menu**: Write a query to select all columns from the `menu_items` table.
2.  **Italian Dishes**: Display the `item_name` and `price` of all items in the 'Italian' category.
3.  **Cheap Eats**: Find all menu items with a price less than $10.00.
4.  **Count the Dishes**: How many unique menu items are there in the table?
5.  **Orders on a Date**: How many orders were placed on '2023-01-01'? (Hint: Count the rows in `order_details`).
6.  **Sort by Price**: List all menu items sorted by price in descending order.
7.  **Null Check**: Are there any orders in `order_details` that have a missing `item_id`?
8.  **Item Popularity**: What is the total number of orders for each menu item? Display the `item_name` and the count of orders.
9.  **Category Revenues**: Calculate the total revenue generated by each `category` (e.g., Italian, Mexican).
10. **Order Sizes**: What is the average number of items per order? (Hint: You need to group by `order_id` first).
11. **Top Spenders**: Which order (`order_id`) had the highest total price?
12. **Daily Trends**: How many orders were placed each day? List the date and the count.
13. **Hourly Rush**: At what hour of the day do most orders occur?
14. **Pricey Categories**: What is the average price of items in each category?
15. **Cumulative Revenue**: Calculate the running total of revenue for each day in January 2023.
16. **Category Growth**: For each category, calculate the month-over-month growth rate in revenue.
17. **Top 3 Per Category**: Using a window function, find the top 3 most ordered items within each category.
18. **High Value Customers**: Identify orders that spent more than the average order value.
19. **Menu Optimization**: Which menu items have never been ordered?
20. **Weekend vs. Weekday**: Compare the average daily revenue between weekends (Saturday/Sunday) and weekdays.
21. **Customer Retention (Proxy)**: Identifying "returning" customers isn't strictly possible without a `customer_id`, but assuming `order_id` implies one visit: Find the distribution of order sizes (e.g., how many orders had 1 item, 2 items, etc.).
